The CGcamera class
==================

*CGcamera* is handle class.

The CGcamera object represents the imaging system. It is composed of a regular camera, a cross-grating, and possibly a relay lens in between. Each of these three components are also represented by objects, respectively from the classes *Camera*, *CrossGrating*, and *RelayLens*.
