Tutorial PhaseLAB (Open classroom mind)



I - LUNARIS IS MEANT TO DEAL WITH QLSI IMAGES, BOTH FOR  EXPERIMENTAL IMAGE POSTPROCESSING AND IMAGE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS.

We shall avoid using functions with an arbitrary long series of inputs. Instead, we use the an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach.

1- start building a microscope
 A microscope consists of 3 components (obj, TL, camera)
OB = Objective(100,1.3,'Olympus');

CGcam = CGcamera('Silios_mono');

MI = Microscope(OB, 180, CGcam);

You may say the illumination is missing. Yes, we chose to consider it separately:
IL = Illumination(lamdba).




Course 2: Import your images

I- how to import specific object and reference interferogram files
Itf = Interferogram(fileName1,MI);
Ref = Interferogram(fileName2,MI);

Itf.Reference(Ref);

The interest of specifying MI while creating the Interfero object is that we know which camera was using when acquiring the interferogram : Itf.CGcam.


other option, in 2 steps:

imItf = imread(fileName1);
Itf = Interferogram(imItf,MI);


Other option. It the images were acquired using PhaseLAB, then one can use the importItfRef function that automatically import the object and reference interfero, and associate them automatically.

[Itf, Ref] = importItfRef(folderName, MI);




Course 3: process your interferograms

Lets summarize what we have seen so far:



OB = Objective(100,1.3,'Olympus');
CGcam = CGcamera('Silios_mono');
MI = Microscope(OB, 180, CGcam);

[Itf, Ref] = importItfRef(folderName, MI);



The 4th line to write is

IM = Itf.QLSIprocess(IL);
