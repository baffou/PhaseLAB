    This method returns the value of the incident field, at the center of the field of view, at the image plane (not at the image plane). If ``obj`` is already an incident field, it simply returns its value at the center of the field of view.

    ``obj`` can by a vector of *ImageEM* objects. In that case, the treatment will be perform on all the objects of the list.
