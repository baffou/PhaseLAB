    ``ref`` is an *Interfero* object supposed to be the reference interferogram of the *Interfero* ``obj``. The method ``Reference`` assigns ``ref`` as the reference of ``obj``.

    ``obj`` can be a list (vector) of interferogram. In that case, ``ref`` is assigned to all of them, without being duplicated.

    ``ref`` can be a list (vector) of interferogram, as long as it has the same number of objects as ``obj``. in that case, the reference interferograms of ``ref`` are assigned one by one to the interferograms of ``obj``.
