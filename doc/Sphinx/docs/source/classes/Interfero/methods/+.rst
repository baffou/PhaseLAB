    The method overload the operator ``+`` by defining the method ``plus``. It actually adds the two interferograms ``obj1.Itf`` and ``obj2.Itf`` and stores the result in attribue ``Itf`` of the output ``obj``. It does the same for the references  ``obj1.Ref.Itf`` and ``obj2.Ref.Itf``.

    The method also work with several additions at a time: ``obj = obj1 + obj2 + ... + objN;``
