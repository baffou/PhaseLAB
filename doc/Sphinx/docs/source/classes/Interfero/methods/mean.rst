    ``objList`` is a vector of *Interferogram* images. ``mean(objList)`` returns a single interferogram where the properties ``Itf`` is an image that is the average of the ``Itf`` images of all the interferograms of ``objList``. The method is also applied to the ``Itf.Ref`` *Interfero* object, so that the average is also performed on the reference images.
