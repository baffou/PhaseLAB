    The ``shine`` method runs a DDA numerical simulation of the electromgnetic field generated inside a dipole, or inside a set of dipoles (*Dipole* vector). In the latter case, the interaction between the dipoles is taken into account. The presence of a substrate is also taken into account. This method provides values to all the missing properties, namely:
    
    - ``p``, the electric dipolar moment of the object(s),
    - ``EE0``, the local electric field vector of the incident illumination at the location of the dipole(s).
    - ``n_ext`` the refractive index of the surroundings

    .. warning::

        *Dipole* is not a handle class. An output argument must be returned when using the *shine* method, otherwise the object is not modified.
