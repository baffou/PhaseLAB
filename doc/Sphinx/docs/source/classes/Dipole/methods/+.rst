    The method overloads the operator ``+`` by defining the method ``plus``. It simply creates a *Dipole* 2-vector with the two input: ``obj = [obj1,  obj2];``. Once they are assembled this way, the dipoles are considered as coupled for any further DDA computation using :ref:`The_imaging_function`.

    The method also work with several additions at a time: ``obj = obj1 + obj2 + ... + objN;``
