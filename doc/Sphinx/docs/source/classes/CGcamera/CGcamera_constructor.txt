    :matlab:`obj = CGcamera()` creates an empty *CGcamera* object.

    |hr|


    :matlab:`obj = CGcamera(camName)` creates a *CGcamera* object that consists only of a camera (no relay-lens, no cross-grating). ``camName`` is a *char* that defines the camera. The camera names must correspond to the names of the files contained in the folder **spec/cameras**. For instance, :matlab:`obj = CGcamera('Zyla');`.

    |hr|


    :matlab:`obj = CGcamera(CGcamName)` creates a *CGcamera* object from the name of a QLSI device. The CGcamera names must correspond to the names of the files contained in the folder **spec/CGcameras**. For instance, :matlab:`obj = CGcamera('Silios_mono');`.

    |hr|


    :matlab:`obj = Interfero(camName, CGname)` creates a *CGcamera* object ``obj`` from the specification of a camera and a cross-grating. ``camName`` is the *char* name of the camera, and ``CGname`` is the *char* name of the cross-grating. The possible names of camera and cross-grating are the names of the files contained in the folder **spec/cameras** and **spec/CG**. For instance, :matlab:`obj = CGcamera('Zyla','P4');`.

    :matlab:`obj = Interfero(camName, CGname, zoom)` creates a *CGcamera* object ``obj`` from the specification of a camera, a cross-grating, and a zoom. ``camName`` is the *char* name of the camera, ``CGname`` is the *char* name of the cross-grating, and ``zoom`` is a number that corresponds to the zoom of a relay lens. The specification of a zoom value leads to the creation of a non-empty ``RL`` properties in the *CGcamera* object, i.e., it creates a relay-lens.

    Each pre-defined CGcamera is associated with a file located in the **spec/CGcameras**. This file contains all the characteristics of the CG camera. Here is for instance a copy of the Silios_mono.txt file:

    .. code-block::
        :caption: Silios_mono.txt

        dexel size: 5.5e-6
        Gamma: 33e-6
        Nx: 2048
        Ny: 2048
        distance: 0.75e-3
        CGdepth: 550e-9
        CGangle: 57.0078

    The folder **CGcameras** contains *.txt* files associated to each predefined camera, namely:

    - *sC8-830.txt*

        A sC8 camera from Phasics we own at the Institut Fresnel, with the reference number 830.

    - *sC8-944.txt*

        A sC8 camera from Phasics we own at the Institut Fresnel, with the reference number 944.

    - *Sid4-CRHEA.txt*

        A Sid4-HR camera from Phasics own by the CRHEA in Nice, France.

    - *Sid4-Element-Sona.txt*

        Our Sid4-Element from Phasics, associated with a Sona camera from Andor

    - *Sid4Element.txt*

        Our Sid4-Element from Phasics, associated with a Zyla 5.5 camera from Andor

    - *Silios_mono.txt*

        The wavefront camera from Silios


    If other QLSI cameras are being used, new custom files can be made, following this pattern and placed in the **spec/CGcamera** folder.


    If other QLSI cameras are being used, new custom files can be made, following this pattern. Any new file can be saved in the **spec/CGcamera** folder, or in any other folder known by Matlab. However, in order to simply keep track of the updated versions of PhaseLAB via Github, I suggest to store any custom-made file to a separate folder, out of the |PhaseLAB| package, and include this directory in the Matlab paths. Also, feel free to contact me to ask for any file addition/modification in the public Github version of |PhaseLAB| that would suit your studies.
