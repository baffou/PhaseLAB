    The method overloads the operator ``+`` by defining the method ``plus``. It returns a *ImageQLSI* object with a weighted sum of the two wavefront and intensity images, defined by:

    .. math::
        
        W_\mathrm{out} &= \frac{W_1T_1+W_2T_2}{T_1+T_2}
        
        T_\mathrm{out} &= \frac{T_1+T_2}{2}
        


    Such a summation makes sense if the different wavefronts are incoherent with each other. If the wavefront originate from a single coherent light source, then the objects should belong to the *ImageEM* class, which rather deals with electromagnetic fields.

    The method also work with several additions at a time: ``obj = obj1 + obj2 + ... + objN;``
