TITLE="Polynomial Approximation: An alternative to Windowing in {F}ourier Analysis",
BOOKTITLE="International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC

MONTH=5,
YEAR=2011,
KEYWORDS="Gram polynomials, Gibbs error, Windowing, Fourier analysis.",
ABSTRACT="This paper presents polynomial approximation as an alternative to classical
windowing in Fourier Analysis. It is demonstrated the the new method is
superior for a certain class of signals and in particular when using the
FFT to perform normalized phase correlation. An algebraic analysis of the
new process is presented: the position dependence of the Gibbs error
associated with polynomial approximation is analyzed and demonstrated; and
the covariance propagation, i.e. noise behaviour of the new method, is
computed. The new method is best suited in applications where intermediate
frequencies are to be estimated and it is important not to have spectral
spreading of the signal."
